# Ralph Progress Log

Feature: Dark Mode Improvements
Parent Task: 13

## Codebase Patterns
- oxlint config is at .oxlintrc.json; rules must be sorted alphabetically (eslint/sort-keys rule enforced)
- Root devDependencies are installed with: pnpm add -D -w <package>
- Validation: pnpm check (runs oxlint --type-aware + types + format)

## 2026-02-15 - Create shared theme init helper

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019c64e5-572e-723d-bdf6-f2fd52df59ba
Task ID: 14

- Created `packages/ui/src/lib/theme-init.ts` with `getThemeInitScript()` function
- Returns inline JS string that reads localStorage `theme`, checks `prefers-color-scheme`, toggles `dark` class, and sets `colorScheme` style
- Importable as `@repo/ui/lib/theme-init` via existing wildcard exports
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Subsequent tasks (15+) should update both `__root.tsx` files to import and use this helper instead of inline scripts

## 2026-02-15 - Update __root.tsx files to use shared theme init helper

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019c64e6-c9c0-77be-9fac-d4aedd9b06f7
Task ID: 15

- Updated `apps/dotdev/src/routes/__root.tsx` to import and use `getThemeInitScript()` from `@repo/ui/lib/theme-init`
- Updated `apps/dotrun/src/routes/__root.tsx` to import and use `getThemeInitScript()` from `@repo/ui/lib/theme-init`
- Removed duplicated inline theme init scripts from both files
- Kept `suppressHydrationWarning` on `<html>` elements in both apps
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Import ordering matters for formatting — run `pnpm format:fix:repo` after edits

## 2026-02-15 - Add cross-tab sync via storage event listener

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019c64e8-be24-7693-a945-436cccf71931
Task ID: 16

- Added `storage` event listener in `ThemeProvider` to sync theme changes across tabs
- Updated `applyTheme` to set `document.documentElement.style.colorScheme` alongside the `dark` class toggle
- Simplified `applyTheme` by computing `isDark` boolean once instead of branching on theme value
- Unified cleanup: effect now always returns a cleanup function that removes both `storage` and `change` listeners
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The `storage` event only fires in *other* tabs (not the one that wrote), so no infinite loop risk
  - Task 17 should add `color-scheme` CSS declarations to `theme.css` to complement the inline style set here

## 2026-02-15 - Add color-scheme CSS declarations to theme.css

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019c64ea-2499-7437-8a83-069511a5e4ae
Task ID: 17

- Added `color-scheme: light;` to `:root` in `packages/ui/src/styles/theme.css`
- Added `color-scheme: dark;` to `.dark` in `packages/ui/src/styles/theme.css`
- This complements the inline `document.documentElement.style.colorScheme` set by `applyTheme` in task 16
- Native browser UI elements (scrollbars, form controls, color-scheme-aware CSS) now automatically match the theme even before JS hydrates
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `color-scheme` CSS property is the CSS-native way to hint the browser about expected color scheme; it affects default colors of form controls, scrollbars, and other browser-chrome elements
  - Having both CSS declaration and JS inline style is intentional: CSS handles pre-hydration, JS handles dynamic switches
